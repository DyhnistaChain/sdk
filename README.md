# DYHNISTA

**BY DYHNISTA | Dynamic Graph-Based Memory System**

DYHNISTA is a dynamic graph-based memory system designed to model, connect, and evolve knowledge in real time.  
Built for intelligent systems, AI agents, and data-driven applications that require contextual, relational, and adaptive memory structures.

---

## 🚀 Overview

DYHNISTA transforms traditional static data storage into a living, evolving knowledge graph.

Instead of storing information in isolated records, DYHNISTA connects data as dynamic nodes and edges — enabling:

- Context-aware memory retrieval
- Relationship-driven reasoning
- Adaptive knowledge expansion
- Intelligent data linking
- Graph-powered AI workflows

It is designed for modern AI systems that need structured, persistent, and evolving memory.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

At its foundation, DYHNISTA operates on:

- **Nodes** → Represent entities, concepts, or memory units  
- **Edges** → Define relationships between nodes  
- **Weights** → Indicate strength, frequency, or importance  
- **Dynamic Updates** → Memory evolves as new data is introduced  

This structure enables contextual reasoning and intelligent memory traversal.
